# Udacity - Data Wrangling
## Overview
This project was my second class for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. I learned about the different steps of data wrangling such as gathering, 
cleaning, storing, analyzing, and visualizing. I collected data from Twitter API data on the twitter account WeRateDogs. I cleaned the data based on 
quality and tidiness issues, and I displayed the cleaning process with the steps of defining my solution, coding it, then testing. The data was stored
into a master dataset, then I gained insights and made a visualization on one of the insights. I created an ACT report that was in the form of an article
to discuss the insights discovered. I also created a wrangle report that discussed the steps of my data wrangling process in this project.

### Software Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- python

### Files Used
- twitter-archive-enhanced.csv
- tweet_json.txt
- image_predictions.tsv
- act_report.pdf (Insights discovered report)
- wrangle_report.pdf (Discussion of wrangling process)

### Insights
1. The percentage of ratings over the rating threshold of 10 in WeRateDogs twitter account is 57.92%. 
That means that over half of the ratings provided go over the threshold and WeRateDogs is true to their rating system of more often 
going above the threshold of 10 than not.

2. The most common dog name, beside no dog name given, in this dataset is Charlie, which is a total of 11 dogs in the dataset named Charlie.
But even though Charlie is the most common, it is very small in comparison to the dog's not named in the dataset as seen by the visualization below.

3. Is retweeting WeRateDogs tweets or liking their tweets more popular? Well from the analysis above we can see that liking WeRateDogs tweets
is more popular than retweets. From this analysis, it seems that more people get their own amusement out of these tweets compared to sharing that 
amusement with others.
